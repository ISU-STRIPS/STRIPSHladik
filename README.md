  - Only flowering portion of plant was extracted for analysis if flowers were available; if not, whole plants were homogenized and extracted.
  
Data units:

  - Mass units are grams.
  - Concentrations are in ng/g, or nanograms of neonicotiniod per mass of material.
  - The minimum detection limit was ~ 1 ng/g.
  - Volume units are liters.
  
Abbreviations:

  - “nd” = non-detect
  - Within the "type" column, "rep," "spike," and "blank" refer to samples  run for quality assurance. Rep = repeat. Spike = sample spiked with target chemicals. Blank = dionized water handled in the field. Env = sample collected from the environment.
